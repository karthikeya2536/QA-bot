# **üìö Small Language Model for Question Answering**
This project develops a **Small Language Model (SLM)** for **question answering** using a book as context. The model retrieves relevant text and extracts precise answers.

## **üöÄ Approach**
1. **Text Retrieval**: Uses **FAISS** and **Sentence Transformers** to fetch the most relevant passage.  
2. **Question Answering**: Uses a **DistilBERT QA model** to extract answers.  
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: If QA fails, it selects the best matching sentence.  

---

## **üß† Model Architecture**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval Model** (Semantic Search)
- **Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Purpose:** Converts book paragraphs into vector embeddings.  
- **Indexing:** Uses **FAISS (L2 distance)** for fast search.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Question Answering Model** (Extractive QA)
- **Model:** `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad`
- **Input:** `(question, retrieved context)`
- **Output:** Extracted answer span.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fallback Matching**
- If the extracted answer is **too short** or **low confidence**, we:
  - Split the context into sentences.
  - Select the **best matching** sentence based on **cosine similarity** with the question.

---

## **üîÑ Preprocessing Techniques**
### **1. Text Splitting & Cleaning**
- **Paragraph Segmentation**: Splitting text based on **double newlines**.
- **Sentence Tokenization**: Used **regex-based sentence splitting**.
- **Lowercasing**: Ensures uniform text processing.

### **2. Embedding Generation**
- **Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Conversion:** Each paragraph is transformed into a **dense vector**.
- **Storage:** FAISS index stores these embeddings.

---

## **üß¨ Retrieval & Answering Mechanism**
### **Step 1: Retrieve Context**
1. Convert **question** into an **embedding**.
2. Find **top-k similar passages** in the FAISS index.
3. Combine them into a **retrieval context**.

### **Step 2: Extract Answer**
1. Pass **(question, context)** to `DistilBERT` QA model.
2. Extract the most **probable answer span**.
3. If the answer is **too short**, use **fallback matching**.

---

## **üåü Evaluation Methodology**
### **Metrics Used**
- **Exact Match (EM)**: Measures perfect matches.
- **F1 Score**: Evaluates partial correctness.
- **Retrieval Accuracy**: Checks if the correct passage is retrieved.

### **Testing Process**
- **Validation Set:** Manually curated questions.
- **Baseline Comparison:** Compared with **random retrieval**.

---

## **üíª How to Run the Model**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install torch transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Book File**
- Place the book in `book.txt` in the root directory.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Model**
```bash
python main.py
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Ask Questions**
```bash
Ask a question: What is machine learning?
Answer: Machine learning is a subset of AI where machines learn from data...
Context: Chapter 2: Machine Learning Basics...
```

## **üêù GitHub Repository Instructions**
1. **Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slm-qa.git
cd slm-qa
```

2. **Run the Model** (Follow steps above)
3. **Modify & Contribute**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Improve retrieval mechanism"
git push origin main
```

üéâ **Congratulations! Your SLM for QA is now set up.** üöÄ

Observations & Key Learnings
Importance of Context Retrieval

A Small Language Model (SLM) struggles with long-form text comprehension. Efficient retrieval mechanisms, like FAISS and Sentence Transformers, significantly improve the quality of answers by selecting the most relevant passages.
Setting an optimal similarity threshold is crucial to filter out irrelevant paragraphs.
Challenges in Answer Extraction

QA models like DistilBERT can fail when the context is ambiguous or lacks a direct answer.
Token alignment issues (e.g., handling subword tokens like "##ing") need careful post-processing to generate coherent responses.
Short answers (fewer than 4 words) often indicate failure, requiring fallback strategies.
Fallback Mechanisms Improve Reliability

When QA extraction fails, using sentence similarity ranking helps extract the best possible sentence.
Ensuring at least one complete sentence in the answer reduces incorrect or incomplete responses.
Efficient Computation Matters

Encoding the entire book in advance speeds up retrieval, but requires memory optimization for large books.
Batch encoding can be used to speed up FAISS indexing for larger datasets.
Model Selection & Limitations

DistilBERT is lightweight and fast but lacks deeper contextual understanding.
A more advanced fine-tuned model (like BERT-Large or T5) could enhance performance, but at the cost of computational efficiency.
Practicality of an SLM for QA

While powerful, SLMs are best suited for specific domains where the knowledge scope is predefined.
Scaling this solution for larger datasets requires efficient chunking strategies and incremental indexing to handle large texts dynamically.
